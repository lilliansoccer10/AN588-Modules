# Module 9: Introduction to Statistical Inference 

```{r}
library(curl)
```

```{r}
n <- 1000
mu <- 3.5
sigma <- 4
v <- rnorm(n, mu, sigma)
s <- sample(v, size = 30, replace = FALSE)
m <- mean(s)
m
```

```{r}
sd <- sd(s)
sd
sem <- sd(s)/sqrt(length(s))
sem
lower <- m - qnorm(1 - 0.05/2) * sem  # (1-alpha)/2 each in the upper and lower tails of the distribution
upper <- m + qnorm(1 - 0.05/2) * sem  # (1-alpha)/2 each in the upper and lower tails of the distribution
ci <- c(lower, upper)
ci
```

## The Central Limit Theorem

```{r}
lambda <- 14
n <- 10
pop_se <- sqrt(lambda/n)  # the estimated SE
pop_se
```
```{r}
x <- NULL
for (i in 1:1000) {
    x[i] <- mean(rpois(n = n, lambda = lambda))
}
hist(x, breaks = seq(from = lambda - 4 * sqrt(lambda)/sqrt(n), to = lambda +
    4 * sqrt(lambda)/sqrt(n), length.out = 20), probability = TRUE)
```
```{r}
sd <- sd(x)  # st dev of the sampling distribution
sd
```
```{r}
qqnorm(x)
qqline(x)
```
```{r}
n <- 100
pop_se <- sqrt(lambda/n)  # the estimated SE
pop_se
```
```{r}
x <- NULL
for (i in 1:1000) {
    x[i] <- mean(rpois(n = n, lambda = lambda))
}
hist(x, breaks = seq(from = lambda - 4 * sqrt(lambda)/sqrt(n), to = lambda +
    4 * sqrt(lambda)/sqrt(n), length.out = 20), probability = TRUE)
```
```{r}
sd <- sd(x)  # st dev of the sampling distribution
sd
```

```{r}
qqnorm(x)
qqline(x)
```

```{r}
curve(dnorm(x, 0, 1), -4, 4, ylim = c(0, 0.8))
z <- (x - lambda)/pop_se
hist(z, breaks = seq(from = -4, to = 4, length.out = 20), probability = TRUE,
    add = TRUE)
```

```{r}
n <- 100
x <- NULL
for (i in 1:1000) {
    x[i] <- sum(rpois(n = n, lambda = lambda))
}
hist(x, breaks = seq(min(x), max(x), length.out = 20), probability = TRUE)
```

## Confidence Intervals for Sample Proportions

### Challenge

```{r}
n <- 1000
x <- 856
phat <- x/n  # our estimate of pi
phat
```
```{r}
n * phat
n * (1 - phat)
pop_se <- sqrt((phat) * (1 - phat)/n)
```
```{r}
curve(dnorm(x, mean = phat, sd = pop_se), phat - 4 * pop_se, phat + 4 * pop_se)
upper <- phat + qnorm(0.975) * pop_se
lower <- phat - qnorm(0.975) * pop_se
ci <- c(lower, upper)
polygon(cbind(c(ci[1], seq(from = ci[1], to = ci[2], length.out = 1000), ci[2]),
    c(0, dnorm(seq(from = ci[1], to = ci[2], length.out = 1000), mean = phat,
        sd = pop_se), 0)), border = "black", col = "gray")
abline(v = ci)
abline(h = 0)
```
### Small Sample Confidence Intervals

```{r}
mu <- 0
sigma <- 1
curve(dnorm(x, mu, 1), mu - 4 * sigma, mu + 4 * sigma, main = "Normal Curve=red\nStudent's t=blue",
    xlab = "x", ylab = "f(x)", col = "red", lwd = 3)
for (i in c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 20, 100)) {
    curve(dt(x, df = i), mu - 4 * sigma, mu + 4 * sigma, main = "T Curve", xlab = "x",
        ylab = "f(x)", add = TRUE, col = "blue", lty = 5)
}
```
```{r}
n <- 1e+05
mu <- 3.5
sigma <- 4
x <- rnorm(n, mu, sigma)
sample_size <- 30
s <- sample(x, size = sample_size, replace = FALSE)
m <- mean(s)
m
```
```{r}
sd <- sd(s)
sd
sem <- sd(s)/sqrt(length(s))
sem
lower <- m - qnorm(1 - 0.05/2) * sem  # (1-alpha)/2 each in the upper and lower tails of the distribution
upper <- m + qnorm(1 - 0.05/2) * sem  # (1-alpha)/2 each in the upper and lower tails of the distribution
ci_norm <- c(lower, upper)
ci_norm
```

```{r}
lower <- m - qt(1 - 0.05/2, df = sample_size - 1) * sem  # (1-alpha)/2 each in the upper and lower tails of the distribution
upper <- m + qt(1 - 0.05/2, df = sample_size - 1) * sem  # (1-alpha)/2 each in the upper and lower tails of the distribution
ci_t <- c(lower, upper)
ci_t
```

```{r}
sample_size <- 5
s <- sample(x, size = sample_size, replace = FALSE)
m <- mean(s)
m
```

```{r}
sd <- sd(s)
sd
sem <- sd(s)/sqrt(length(s))
sem
```

```{r}
lower <- m - qnorm(1 - 0.05/2) * sem  # (1-alpha)/2 each in the upper and lower tails of the distribution
upper <- m + qnorm(1 - 0.05/2) * sem  # (1-alpha)/2 each in the upper and lower tails of the distribution
ci_norm <- c(lower, upper)
ci_norm
```

```{r}
lower <- m - qt(1 - 0.05/2, df = sample_size - 1) * sem  # (1-alpha)/2 each in the upper and lower tails of the distribution
upper <- m + qt(1 - 0.05/2, df = sample_size - 1) * sem  # (1-alpha)/2 each in the upper and lower tails of the distribution
ci_t <- c(lower, upper)
ci_t
```

### Summary of Challenge
For larger sample sizes, the CIs are similar for normal distributions vs T distributions. For smaller sample sizes, there is a larger difference in the CIs. 


# Module 10: Classical Hypothesis Testing

## Null and Alternative Hypotheses

```{r}
f <- curl("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fuzzyatelin/fuzzyatelin.github.io/master/AN588_Fall23/vervet-weights.csv")
d <- read.csv(f, header = TRUE, sep = ",", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
head(d)
```
```{r}
mean(d$weight)
```

-The null distribution is that the mean is 4.9 kg. 
-The alternative distribution is that the mean is 5.324 kg. 
-It is an upper one tailed test. 

```{r}
mu <- 4.9
x <- d$weight
m <- mean(x)
s <- sd(x)
n <- length(x)
sem <- s/sqrt(n)
```

```{r}
m
s
n
```

```{r}
z <- (m - mu)/sem
z
```
#the estimated number of standard errors of the mean away from the population mean that our sample falls.


### Normal Distribution 
```{r}
p <- 1 - pnorm(z)
p
```

or we can write it as

```{r}
p <- pnorm(z, lower.tail = FALSE) #only looking at the upper tail
p
```

### T Distribution

```{r}
p <- 1 - pt(z, df = n - 1)
p
```

```{r}
p <- pt(z, df = n - 1, lower.tail = FALSE)
p
```

R has built into it a single function, t.test(), that lets us do all this in one line. We give it our data and the expected population mean, Î¼, along with the kind of test we want to do.

### t.test can be used to find the CIs more easily

```{r}
t <- t.test(x = x, mu = mu, alternative = "greater")
t
```
df is degrees of freedom n-1, so length of 51-1 is 50.

### By Hand

```{r}
lower <- m - qt(1 - 0.05/2, df = n - 1) * sem
upper <- m + qt(1 - 0.05/2, df = n - 1) * sem
ci <- c(lower, upper)
ci  # by hand
```

```{r}
t <- t.test(x = x, mu = mu, alternative = "two.sided")
ci <- t$conf.int
ci  # using t test
```


## Challenge 1

```{r}
f <- curl("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fuzzyatelin/fuzzyatelin.github.io/master/AN588_Fall21/woolly-weights.csv")
d <- read.csv(f, header = TRUE, sep = ",", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
head(d)
```

```{r}
x <- d$weight
m <- mean(x)
s <- sd(x)
n <- length(x)
sem <- s/sqrt(n)
mu <- 7.2
t <- (m - mu)/sem
t
```

```{r}
m
s
n
```

```{r}
alpha <- 0.05
crit <- qt(1 - alpha/2, df = n - 1)  # identify critical values
test <- t < -crit || t > crit  # boolean test as to whether t is larger than the critical value at either tail
test <- abs(t) > crit
t.test(x = x, mu = mu, alternative = "two.sided")
```
The averages of the lowland woolly monkeys matches, so we can confirm that the different woolly monkeys is a different species because the mean was different.  
 

### Mean Difference
```{r}
6.427333-5.323922 
```

95% CI of the vervet monkey population
```{r}
5.049585-5.598258
```

95% CI of the woolly monkey population
```{r}
5.930689-6.923978
```

## Challenge 2

```{r}
f <- curl("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fuzzyatelin/fuzzyatelin.github.io/master/AN588_Fall23/colobus-weights.csv")
d <- read.csv(f, header = TRUE, sep = ",", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
head(d)
```

```{r}
x <- d$weight[d$sex == "male"]
y <- d$weight[d$sex == "female"]
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
boxplot(x, ylim = c(4.5, 8), main = "Weight (kg)", xlab = "Males")
boxplot(y, ylim = c(4.5, 8), main = "Weight (kg)", xlab = "Females")
```
```{r}
m1 <- mean(x)
m2 <- mean(y)
mu <- 0  # you could leave this out... the default argument value is 0
s1 <- sd(x)
s2 <- sd(y)
n1 <- length(x)
n2 <- length(y)
```

```{r}
m1
m2
s1 
s2 
n1
n2
```
```{r}
t <- (m2 - m1 - mu)/sqrt(s2^2/n2 + s1^2/n1)
t
```

```{r}
alpha <- 0.05
crit <- qt(1 - alpha/2, df = n - 1)  # identify critical values
crit
```

```{r}
test <- t < -crit || t > crit  # boolean test
test <- abs(t) > crit
test
```

### Degrees of Freedom

```{r}
df <- (s2^2/n2 + s1^2/n1)^2/((s2^2/n2)^2/(n2 - 1) + (s1^2/n1)^2/(n1 - 1))
df
```

### T-Test Function to Find the Degrees of Freedom

```{r}
t <- t.test(x = x, y = y, mu = 0, alternative = "two.sided")
t
```

It is correct to assume that the males weigh more than the females on average seeming how the mean of x is 6.689 and the mean of y is 5.24.  

### Samples with Equal Variences

```{r}
s <- sqrt((((n1 - 1) * s1^2) + ((n2 - 1) * s2^2))/(n1 + n2 - 2))
t <- (m2 - m1 - mu)/(sqrt(s^2 * (1/n1 + 1/n2)))
t
```
```{r}
df <- n1 + n2 - 2
df
```

```{r}
t <- t.test(x = x, y = y, mu = 0, var.equal = TRUE, alternative = "two.sided")
t
```
```{r}
var(x)/var(y)
```

```{r}
vt <- var.test(x, y)
vt
```
### Paired Samples (the data is not dependent - weights are different now vs future... need to take into account that chnages that one of us has is dependent on ourselves not others)

mu = expected difference between the paired samples, which here it will be 0

## Challenge 3

```{r}
f <- curl("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fuzzyatelin/fuzzyatelin.github.io/master/AN588_Fall23/iqs.csv")
d <- read.csv(f, header = TRUE, sep = ",", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
head(d)
```
```{r}
x <- d$IQ.before - d$IQ.after
m <- mean(x)
mu <- 0  # can leave this out
s <- sd(x)
n <- length(x)
sem <- s/sqrt(n)
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
boxplot(d$IQ.before, ylim = c(115, 145), main = "IQ", xlab = "Before")
boxplot(d$IQ.after, ylim = c(115, 145), main = "IQ", xlab = "After")
```


```{r}
t <- (m - mu)/sem
t
```
sample mean - mu / standard error of mean

```{r}
alpha <- 0.05
crit <- qt(1 - alpha/2, df = n - 1)  # identify critical values
crit
```

```{r}
test <- t < -crit || t > crit  # boolean test
test
```

The difference is not equal to zero. It is not significant though because it is equal to 0.08. 

```{r}
t.test(x, df = n - 1, alternative = "two.sided")
```


### Testing Sample Proportions: One Sample Z Test

```{r}
pop <- c(rep(0, 500), rep(1, 500))
```

```{r}
pi <- 0.5
x <- NULL
n <- 10
for (i in 1:1000) {
    x[i] <- mean(sample(pop, size = n, replace = FALSE))  # taking the mean of a bunch of 0s and 1s yields the proportion of 1s!
}
m <- mean(x)
m
```

```{r}
s <- sd(x)
s
```

```{r}
pop_se <- sqrt(pi * (1 - pi)/n)
pop_se  # the se is an estimate of the sd of the sampling distribution
```

```{r}
pop <- c(rep(0, 800), rep(1, 200))
pi <- 0.8
x <- NULL
n <- 10
for (i in 1:1000) {
    x[i] <- mean(sample(pop, size = n, replace = FALSE))  # taking the mean of a bunch of 0s and 1s yields the proportion of 1s!
}
m <- mean(x)
m
```

```{r}
s <- sd(x)
s
```

```{r}
pop_se <- sqrt(pi * (1 - pi)/n)
pop_se  # the se is an estimate of the sd of the sampling distribution
```

This normal approximation is true as long as n is fairly large and Ï is not close to 0 or 1. One rule of thumb is to check that both nÃÏ and nÃ(1âÏ) are greater than 5.


## Challenge 4

```{r}
v <- c(0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0,
    1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1)
```


-The null hypothesis is that there should be 80% success in the nets. 
- The alternative hypothesis is that the rate may be significantly less than 80%.


```{r}
phat <- mean(v)
phat
```
 
```{r}
 pi <- 0.8
n <- 30
z <- (phat - pi)/sqrt(pi * (1 - pi)/30)
z
```

```{r}
p <- pnorm(z, lower.tail = TRUE)
p
```

```{r}
lower <- phat - qnorm(0.975) * sqrt(phat * (1 - phat)/30)
upper <- phat + qnorm(0.975) * sqrt(phat * (1 - phat)/30)
ci <- c(lower, upper)
ci
```

```{r}
pt <- prop.test(x = sum(v), n = length(v), p = 0.8, conf.level = 0.95, correct = FALSE,
    alternative = "less")
pt
```
Yes, she was right that her success rate was significantly lower than previous years. The test statistic falls out of the bounds of the CIs. 

## Challenge 5 

```{r}
v1 <- c(1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0,
    1, 0)
v2 <- c(1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0,
    0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1)
```

-The null is that the two species do not differ in their proportions of lactating females.
-The alternative hypothesis is that they do differ in some way. 


```{r}
pstar <- (sum(v1) + sum(v2))/(length(v1) + length(v2))
pstar
```

```{r}
phat1 <- mean(v1)
phat1
```

```{r}
phat2 <- mean(v2)
phat2
```

```{r}
pi <- 0
z <- (phat2 - phat1)/sqrt((pstar * (1 - pstar)) * (1/length(v1) + 1/length(v2)))
z
```

```{r}
p <- 1 - pnorm(z, lower.tail = TRUE) + pnorm(z, lower.tail = FALSE)
p
```

```{r}
crit <- qnorm(1 - alpha/2)  # identify critical values
crit
```
```{r}
test <- p < -crit || p > crit  # boolean test
test
```
```{r}
pt <- prop.test(x = c(sum(v2), sum(v1)), n = c(length(v2), length(v1)), alternative = "two.sided",
    correct = FALSE)
pt
```

What are her results? Are the proportions of lactating females different across species during this trapping season?

The proportions are different, but the proportions are not significantly different according to the boolean test. The p-value falls within the CI, which is a good sign that the difference is not significant.
