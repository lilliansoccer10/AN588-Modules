Use the following packages: 
```{r}
library(manipulate)
library(prettydoc)
```

## What is the probability that she will hear more than 8 calls during any given session?

```{r}
ppois(8,15,lower.tail = FALSE) 
```

## What is the probability that she will hear no calls in a session?

```{r}
dpois(0,15)
```

## What is the probability that she will hear exactly 3 calls in a session?

```{r}
dpois(3,15)
```

## Plot the relevant Poisson mass function over the values in range 0 ≤ x ≤ 30.
```{r}
x <- 0:30
l = 15
probset <- dpois(x = x, lambda = l)
barplot(probset, names.arg = x, space = 0, xlab = "x", ylab = "Pr(X = x)", main = "Probability Mass Function")
```

## Simulate 104 results from this distribution (i.e., 2 years of Saturday monitoring sessions).

```{r}
B <- rpois(104,15)
B
```

## Plot the simulated results using hist() and use xlim() to set the horizontal limits to be from 0 to 30. 

```{r}
hist(B, main = "2 Years of Morning Sessions", xlim = c(0,30), xlab = "Number of Calls")
```

## How does your histogram compare to the shape of the probability mass function you plotted above?

The frequency is highest in the center just as the mass function plotted above is.
