### What did you accomplish?

***

Please let me know how many of the above tasks you accomplished. If any of them were accomplished later than stipulated, please note that. If you contacted me about them being late (and we discussed it and I said it was ok), please note that, too. You may provide a bulleted/numbered list matching the one above.<br><br>

I completed all assigned readings and modules by class the week they were assigned, unless I did not understand and had to complete them after going over issues in class. 

- Modules 1-23: (https://github.com/lilliansoccer10/AN588-Modules-BackUp) <br>

I completed all of the homework assignments on time with minimal adjustments (if any) after the due date. 

- Homework 1: Push it! (https://github.com/lilliansoccer10/AN588-Week-2-holdenl/blob/main/holdenl_FinalHomeworkCode_01.html) <br>

### How well did you accomplish them?

***

Please let me know how well you feel you accomplished your tasks, in a general sense. What do you feel you did the best, and what did you do the least well? What was the hardest part for you? Did your work/understanding/ease improve over the course of the semester?<br><br>

In a general sense, I believe that I completed all of the tasks assigned to me to the best of my ability. I have never taken a statistics class or a class involving R, so I believe I did an outstanding job, considering. I spent numerous hours on work for this class and countless nights staying up late trying to trouble-shoot issues I was having. When I had issues, I went to office hours when I had time as my schedule as a part tinme graduate student and working part time to pay for school limits my availability. Google was also my best friend in this class! The assignment that I believe I did best on was the group vignette. I was responsible for the Anderson Darling Test and Final Challenge and feel as though I did a great job explaining each step of the ad.test() function within this assignment. This actually was commented on by a peer at the end of our presentation along with finding it helpful to include an example of a test that does not work well with a set of data, which was what I worked on as well.

### How has your understanding of and approach to statistics and project design changed since taking this course?

***

This may be in relation to previous knowledge, or in relation to future/planned work.<br><br>

***

### What did you learn from all this?


***

Please name at least three things you feel you learned in this course.<br><br>

I learned ... 

- How to work with team members in an efficient way using constructive criticism to improve their work as well as my own.
- How to import data into R (ex. read.csv)
- How to organize data in R (ex. piping)
- How to plot data in R (ex. ggplot)
- How to analyze data in R, recognizing statistical significance by looking at alpha values, p-values, and much more in R. 
- How to properly knit files in R in order to display my code and findings in a presentable way. 
- How to use bootstrapping to estimate confidence intervals, standard errors, hypothesis testing and much more.

### What did your learn about teamwork in this course? How did the readings on teamwork foster this understanding? How did the teamwork experiences?

I learned a lot about teamwork within this course. The readings on teamwork helped to foster this understanding to provide a resource that I went to when I was struggling with certain aspects of teammwork including how to give constructive criticism without sounding rude. I tend to come off in a way that is not how I intend to, so reading how to give constructive criticism properly helped me a lot. The teamwork experiences involved in peer-commentary aided in my ability to use collaboration and constructive criticism to better improve my work and to help others improve theirs. In working on the vignete assignment, I found that we had to coordinate meeting in person as well as on zoom, which was difficult at times, but much appreciated.

### How did the Peer Commentary process and Group Project relate, if at all, to what you view as your successes or difficulties in this course?

 -- I think that the peer commentary and group project related because once we each assigned ourselves part of the presentation, we would peer-review each others work and use constructive criticism to do so. We also practiced our presentation and gave constructive feedback on that as well which helped to better improve the presentation, overall. --

### What, if anything, of lasting value do you take away from this experience? If nothing, what would you do differently if you were to start over in this course? 
I believe that this course has gave me the introduction to R that I needed to be able to succeed in the field of ecology as I wish to do so. I wanted to take this course because I know how important of a tool R is in the scientific community. I am excited that I can walk away from it with a basic understanding of R and how it can be used to analyze, plot, organize data, and much more.

### Taking this self-assessment into account (and with **A** being the highest), if you were the instructor, what grade would you give yourself given your evaluation of your own performance this semester? Please be honest.
